# Face Detection and Segmentation
This repository contains code for detecting faces in an input image and segmenting them into individual faces. The code uses adaptive histogram equalization and median filtering to enhance the input image and remove noise, and then applies a cascade object detector to detect the location of faces in the image. The detected faces are then segmented and saved to a specified folder path.
